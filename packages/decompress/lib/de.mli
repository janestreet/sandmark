(** {1 RFC1951/DEFLATE codec.}

    RFC1951/DEFLATE is a IETF standard. Module provides non-blocking streaming
   codec to {{:#decode}decode} and {{:#encode}encode} DEFLATE encoding. It can
   efficiently work payload by payload without blocking IO.

    Module provides {{:#compression}LZ77 compression} algorithm but let the
   client to define his algorithm as long as he uses shared queue provided in
   this module. *)

(** {2 Prelude.}

    [de] wants to be self-contained. By this constraint, it provides convenience
   values to be used by others (like [zz]). The client should not use these
   functions even if they are available. Others libraries like [Bigstringaf]
   serve the same purpose of a much better way. *)

module Bigarray = Bigarray_compat
(** MirageOS compatibility. *)

type bigstring =
  (char, Bigarray.int8_unsigned_elt, Bigarray.c_layout) Bigarray.Array1.t
(** The type for [bigstring]. *)

type optint = Optint.t
(** Type type for optimal integer. *)

val bigstring_empty : bigstring
(** An empty {!bigstring}. *)

val bigstring_create : int -> bigstring
(** [bigstring_create len] returns a uninitialized bigstring of length [len]. *)

val bigstring_length : bigstring -> int
(** [bigstring_length t] is the length of the bigstring [t], in bytes. *)

val io_buffer_size : int

(** {2 Window.} *)

type window
(** The type for windows. *)

val make_window : bits:int -> window
(** [make_window] allocates a new buffer which represents a {i window}. It used
   by decoder and LZ77 compressor to keep tracking older inputs and:

   {ul
   {- process a copy from a distance by the decoder.}
   {- generate a copy from the compression algorithm.}} *)

val window_bits : window -> int

(** {2:decode DEFLATE Decoder.}

    Decoder of RFC1951 DEFLATE codec. [de] provides a {!Inf.decoder} to decode
   DEFLATE input and inflate it. *)

module Inf : sig
  type src = [ `Channel of in_channel | `String of string | `Manual ]
  (** The type for input sources. With a [`Manual] source the client must
     provide input with {!src}. With [`String] or [`Channel] source the client
     can safely discard [`Await] case (with [assert false]). *)

  type decode = [ `Await | `Flush | `End | `Malformed of string ]

  type decoder
  (** The type for decoders. *)

  val decoder : src -> o:bigstring -> w:window -> decoder
  (** [decoder src ~o ~w] is a decoder that inputs from [src].

      {b Output buffer.}

      [de] uses [o] buffer as internal buffer to store output. We recommend to
     allocate an {!io_buffer_size} buffer as output buffer. Then, {!dst_rem}
     gives you how many bytes it remains in [o].

      {b Window.}

      [de] needs a window to be able to interpret [`Copy] code. Length of window
     is commonly 32k bytes (but the client can use a smaller one with some
     assumptions). *)

  val decode : decoder -> decode
  (** [decode d] is:

      {ul
      {- [`Await] if [d] has a [`Manual] input source and awaits for more input.
     The client must use {!src} to provide it.}
      {- [`Flush d] if given output buffer [o] (see {!decoder}) is full. The
     client must use {!flush} to {b completely} flush [o]. {!dst_rem} gives you
     how many bytes it remains in [o]. [Inf.dst_rem d - bigstring_length o] gives
     you how many bytes are available.}
      {- [`Malformed err] if given input is malformed. [err] is a human-readable
     error.}
      {- [`End] if given input notify end of flow. [o] is possibly not empty (it

     @raise Invalid_argument when [j] and [l] do not correspond to a valid

  (** [flush d] provides [d] with new output storage. *)

  val checksum : decoder -> optint
  (** [checkseum d] is ADLER-32 checksum of consumed inputs. *)
end

(** {2 Queue.}

    DEFLATE encoder needs a compressed input which can be transmited by a shared
   queue filled by compression algorithm. {!B} is used between {!N} and a
   compression algorithm like {!L}. It provides a small representation of
   commands (see {!Queue.cmd}) emitted by compression algorithm.

    {!N} encoder interprets {!Queue.cmd} as fast as it can. Shared queue can be a
   bottleneck about the whole compression process. Indeed, it limits encoder on
   how many bytes it can produce. We recommend to make a queue as large as
   output buffer. *)

module Queue : sig
  type cmd [@@immediate]
  (** The type for commands. *)

  type t
  (** The type for queues.

      A command is a small representation of a [`Literal] or a [`Copy] command.
     A [`Copy] command is usually emitted by a compression algorithm to inform
     to copy [length] byte(s) appeared [offset] byte(s) before.

      DEFLATE has some limitations about [`Copy] command. *)

  exception Full
  (** Raised when {!push_exn} is applied to a full queue. *)

  exception Empty
  (** Raised when {!junk_exn} or {!pop_exn} is applied to an empty queue. *)

  val is_empty : t -> bool
  (** Return [true] if the given queue is empty, [false] otherwise. *)

  val is_full : t -> bool

  (** Return the number of elements in the given queue. *)

  val available : t -> int
  (** Free cells available on the given queue. *)

  val push_exn : t -> cmd -> unit
  (** [push_exn q x] adds the element [x] at the end of the queue [q]. It raises
     {!Full} if the given queue [q] is full. *)

  val pop_exn : t -> cmd
  (** [pop_exn q] removes and returns the first element in the given queue [q].
     It raises {!Empty} if the given queue [q] is empty. *)

  val junk_exn : t -> int -> unit
  (** [junk_exn q n] discards [n] elements in the given queue [q]. If [q] does
     not have enough elements, it raises {!Empty} and the given queue is
     unchanged. *)

  val copy : off:int -> len:int -> cmd
  (** [copy ~off ~len] is a {!cmd} for a {i copy} code. *)

  val literal : char -> cmd
  (** [literal chr] is a {!cmd} for a character. *)

  (** [eob] is {i End Of Block} {!cmd}.*)

  (** [cmd command] is {!cmd} from a human-readable value. *)

  (** [blit q payload off len] {i blits} elements in [payload] to the given
     queue [q] at the end (like a fast iterative {!push_exn} with literal
     elements). If the given queue [q] does not have enough free space to write
     [payload], it raises {!Full} and the given queue is unchanged. *)

  val create : int -> t
  (** [create len] allocates a new queue, initially empty. [len] must be a power
     of two, otherwise it raises [Invalid_argument]. *)

  val of_list : [ `Literal of char | `Copy of int * int | `End ] list -> t
end

(** {2 Frequencies.}

    DYNAMIC DEFLATE block needs frequencies of code emitted by compression
   algorithm. {!literals} and {!distances} exist to keep frequencies while
   compression process. *)

type literals = private int array
(** The type of frequencies of literals (including lengths). *)

type distances = private int array
(** The type of frequencies of distances. *)

val make_literals : unit -> literals
(** [make_literals] allocates a new {!literals} where frequencies of symbols
   (expect {i End Of Block}) are set to 0. *)

(** [make_distances] allocates a new {!distances} where frequencies of {i
   distance} symboles are set to 0. *)

val succ_literal : literals -> char -> unit
(** [succ_literals literals chr] increases frequency of [chr]. *)

val succ_length : literals -> int -> unit
(** [succ_length literals l] increases frequency of [l] code. [l] must be upper
   than 2 and lower than 259 according DEFLATE codec. Otherwise, it raises an
   [Invalid_argument]. *)

val succ_distance : distances -> int -> unit
(** [succ_distance distance d] increases frequency of [d] code. [d] must be
   upper than 0 and lower than 32769 according DEFLATE codec. Otherwise, it
   raises an [Invalid_argument]. *)

(** {2:encode DEFLATE Encoder.} *)

module Def : sig
  type dst = [ `Channel of out_channel | `Buffer of Buffer.t | `Manual ]
  (** The type for output destinations. With a [`Manual] destination the client
     must provide output storage with {!dst}. With [`String] or [`Channel]
     destination the client can safely discard [`Flush] case (with [assert false]). *)

  type dynamic
  (** The type for DEFLATE DYNAMIC block. *)

  (** The type for DEFLATE header block. *)
  type kind =
    | Flat of int
        (** A [Flat len] block is a non-compressed block of [len] byte(s). After a

     are not a part of resulted Huffman tree). At the end, a [dynamic] Huffman
     tree is able to encode a subset of symbols.

      If all frequencies are upper than 0, resulted [dynamic] Huffman tree is
     able to encode any symbols. *)

  type encoder
  (** The type for DEFLATE encoders. *)

  val encoder : dst -> q:Queue.t -> encoder
  (** [encoder dst ~q] is an encoder that outputs to [dst].

      {b Internal queue.}

      [encoder] needs a side-channel about compressed inputs. To pass
     compression values to [encoder], we use a queue [q]. Length of it can be a
     bottleneck where a small one will let {!encode} to emit too many [`Flush]
     (which is commonly associated to a {i syscall}). We recommend a queue as
     large as output buffer. *)

  val encode : encoder -> encode -> [ `Ok | `Partial | `Block ]
  (** [encode e v] is:

      {ul
      {- [`Partial] iff [e] has a [`Manual] destination and needs more output

     where [block] is a new block able to encode current {!Queue.cmd}.}}

      {b How to signal end of flow?}

      End of flow is characterized by a {!block} where [last = true]. Then, the

     [j] in [s]. This byte range is read by calls to {!encode} with [e] until

     [Invalid_argument]. *)
end

(** {2:compression LZ77 compression algorithm.}

    Distribution provides LZ77 compression algorithm which can be used with
   {!N}. However, the client must know others algorithms exist. This algorithm
   is used by [zz] to implement ZLIB layer. *)

module Lz77 : sig
